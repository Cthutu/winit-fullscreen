# winit-fullscreen

This is a simple crate that manages toggling of fullscreen in a winit-based
application.  Given a borrowed immutable reference to your
`winit::window::Window` instance, you can call:

```rust
window.toggle_fullscreen();
```

If your window is not fullscreen, it will be now, otherwise the reverse will be true.
